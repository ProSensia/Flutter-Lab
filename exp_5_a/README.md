Learn about stateful and stateless widgets.

Stateful widgets are widgets that can change their state over time. They are used when the UI needs to update dynamically based on user interactions or other events. Stateful widgets have a mutable state object that can be modified, and when the state changes, the widget is rebuilt to reflect the new state.

Stateless widgets, on the other hand, are widgets that don't have any mutable state. They are used when the UI doesn't need to change based on user interactions or events. Stateless widgets are immutable, meaning that once they are built, they cannot be modified.

In Flutter, you can create stateful and stateless widgets by extending the `StatefulWidget` and `StatelessWidget` classes respectively. Stateful widgets have a corresponding `State` class that holds the mutable state, while stateless widgets don't have a separate state class.

To learn more about stateful and stateless widgets in Flutter, you can refer to the official Flutter documentation.
