srinu2003: /explain What is this at the end of Object?

Will youo please help me understand this programming style with examples

 syntax in Dart is known as the **cascade notation**. It allows you to make a sequence of operations on the same object. This can make your code more concise and readable by chaining multiple method calls or property accesses on the same object.

Here's a simple example to illustrate the use of cascade notation:

```dart
class Car {
  String color;
  int speed;

  Car(this.color, this.speed);

  void paint(String newColor) {
    color = newColor;
  }

  void accelerate(int increment) {
    speed += increment;
  }

  void display() {
    print('Car color: $color, speed: $speed');
  }
}

void main() {
  var myCar = Car('red', 0)
    ..paint('blue')
    ..accelerate(50)
    ..display();
}
```

In this example:
- We create a `Car` object with initial color `red` and speed `0`.
- Using cascade notation (`..`), we call the `paint`, `accelerate`, and `display` methods on the same `Car` object without having to repeat the object name (`myCar`) each time.

Without cascade notation, the same code would look like this:

```dart
void main() {
  var myCar = Car('red', 0);
  myCar.paint('blue');
  myCar.accelerate(50);
  myCar.display();
}
```

As you can see, cascade notation helps to make the code more concise and readable by reducing repetition.

In your provided code snippet:
```dart
..forward();
```
It suggests that `forward()` is being called on an object using cascade notation. To understand it fully, you would need to look at the preceding lines to see what object is being operated on.

If you have more specific code or context, feel free to share, and I can provide a more detailed explanation!
